        <h3>The Three Basics of Photography</h3>

        <p>Getting started in the world of digital photography today can seem overwhelming. Our digital SLRs have more buttons, dials, and menu options than any person can reasonably be expected to keep track of. Don’t be fooled. If we brush aside the terminology and sales gimmicks, photography today is just as simple as it was 50 years ago; maybe even simpler. There are really only three things that you need to learn to understand photography. Once you understand these three basic elements, and how they relate to each other, you’ll only be limited by your own creativity and desire to practice. These things are:</p>

        <div class="basics-text">
        <h5>Shutter Speed</h5>

        <p>From a mechanical perspective, shutter-speed is pretty simple. I think we all know that in order to make a photo, our camera’s sensor (or film) needs a certain amount of light, and the shutter is simply a door to let light into an otherwise light-proof box where the sensor resides. <strong>Shutter Speed</strong> is the duration that the shutter is open, and as you’d expect, the longer it stays open, the more light is able to get to the sensor. If the shutter stays open for 2 seconds, twice as much light gets through as if it were only open for 1 second, for example, and ½ of a second lets in twice as much light as ¼.</p>

        <p>From a creative perspective, the effect of shutter speed is also pretty easy to understand. Since the sensor is exposed to light for as long as the shutter is open, it records an image of how far the subject moves during that time. A human can move quite a bit during one second, or even a half-second, so a 1 or ½ second shutter speed will record a blurry image of a moving person. On the other hand, even the fastest person can’t move very far in 1/1000th of a second, so that shutter speed will be great for stopping action.</p>

        <h5>Aperture</h5>

        <p>The aperture of this lens is at it’s smallest setting, but can still easily be seen in the center of the lens. The 8 blades that form the aperture can also been seen. Not as many people are familiar with what a camera’s aperture is, but there’s nothing difficult about it, either, once you see what it is. If you look into an <span class="text-uppercase">slr</span> lens, you’ll see a set of blades that form a hole in the middle to let light pass through. That hole is the <strong>aperture</strong>, and the lens can move those blades to make the hole smaller or larger. The larger the hole, the more light gets through, obviously. Your camera’s aperture control, then, is another way to change how much light gets to the sensor.</p>

        <p>Changes in the aperture also change how your photos look. The size of the aperture controls how much of the image appears to be in focus behind and in front of what you’re focused on. For example, suppose that you’re taking a picture of somebody who is standing across the room from you, and you can see trees through the big window behind them. If you take the picture with the lens’ smallest aperture (which lets in the <span class="text-uppercase">least</span> amount of light), the trees in the background will also be relatively sharp in focus. However, if you take the photo using the lens’s largest aperture, the trees in the background will be very blurry, maybe not even recognizable as trees.</p>

        <p>This effect is called “Depth of Field”. When the background gets blurry very quickly as it gets further from the subject, we call it “shallow” depth of field.  If most of the picture appears to be in focus, from near to far, we call it “deep” instead. Although I’ve been talking about the background of the subject, the same thing is true of the foreground; in fact, foreground objects go out of focus even more quickly than background when depth of field is shallow. The term “Depth of Field” is frequently shortened to “DoF” on this website and on the internet in general. So to summarize, we can say that the use of small apertures creates greater (deeper) DoF, while using larger apertures creates shallow DoF.</p>

        <p>In both pictures, the camera is focused on the front face of the teapot, and both are sharp there. However, on the left, the aperture was set to a very small size, so the containers behind and in front are close to being in focus, too. On the right, though, a large aperture was used, so the containers are very blurry.</p>

        <h5 class="text-uppercase">Iso</h5>

        <p>Those of you who used to buy film will recall that you had a choice of different types. In most stores, you could buy 100, 200 and 400 speed films, and in a good camera shop, you could buy many more than that. These numbers are the film’s <em><span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> rating</em>, sometimes called the film-speed (or before the 1990s, it was called the <span class="text-uppercase">asa</span>). With film, the higher the number (eg, 400, 800, 1600), the more “sensitive”1 the film was to light, so it could be used in darker environments. The lower the number (eg, 50, 100, 200), the less sensitive to light it was, making it better suited to use in bright daylight.</p>

        <p>So why wouldn’t people just shoot <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> 1600 film all the time? Unfortunately, higher speed film was also more grainy and had duller colors.</p>

        <p>Strangely enough, <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> is almost exactly the same in digital cameras. Most cameras have a base <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> setting of about 100. To increase the apparent sensitivity of the sensor, the camera amplifies the signal that the sensor captures, and modern cameras can generally be pushed all the way up to <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> 6400, 12800, 25600 or higher.</p>

        <p>This gives them the ability to capture photos in pretty low light, but unfortunately, all of that extra amplification also increases the background data from the camera’s electronics. Think about an audio recording of a voice you’ve made where the voice was too <strong>quiet</strong>… maybe you recorded a video of someone across the room with your phone, or you recorded a lecture from the back row and it’s hard to make out the voice. You can turn up the volume when you play it to make the voice louder, but that also increases the <strong>background hiss</strong> and other noises from the room, so it's often still hard to hear.</p>

        <p>The same thing is true with a high <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> setting. Shooting at high <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> “turns up the volume” of a small amount of data captured from the sensor, but it also turns up the background noise from the camera’s electronics. The result is a very grainy looking image, usually with  dull or inaccurate colors and lower detail resolution. This phenomenon is known as <strong>“digital noise”</strong>.</p>
        </div class="basics-text">

        <h4>Exposure: Working Together</h4>

        <p>To get a better grip on how these three elements work together to create a photograph, an analogy may be helpful. Think of it this way: taking a photograph is like filling a bucket with water from a hose. If you fill the bucket all the way but don’t overflow, we could say that we have a <strong>correct exposure</strong>. In photography, getting a correct exposure means that the right amount of light gets to the sensor for the <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> setting, creating a picture that is not too bright or too dark.</p>

        <p>The <strong>shutter speed</strong> is like the <em>valve on the faucet:</em> you turn it on for a little while to let the water flow through, and then turn it off again. (For the sake of the analogy, assume that the valve only turns the water <span class="text-uppercase">on</span> or <span class="text-uppercase">off</span>, like the motion-sensor activated faucets in public restrooms.) If you leave it on for too long, the bucket will overflow, but if you turn it off too quickly, it won’t fill up. Similarly, if you use a shutter speed that is too long, too much light will come through and the picture will be too bright, but if you use a shutter speed that’s too short, not enough light will get through and the picture will be too dark.</p>

        <p>The <strong>aperture</strong> is like the <em>size of the hose</em>. If we use a standard garden hose to fill the bucket, it will take more time than if we use a fire hose. Even assuming that the water pressure is the same in each case (and we should, for this analogy), a hose that carries twice as much water will fill the bucket twice as fast. If, on the other hand, you use a tiny hose (like aquarium tubing), it will take quite a while longer to fill up the bucket. Aperture works the same way. If you double the size of the aperture, twice as much light will get through to the sensor in the same amount of time.</p>

        <p>The <span class="text-uppercase"><em>Iso</em></span> is like the size of the bucket. If you double the size of the bucket, it will take twice as long to fill it with the same size hose OR the same amount of time with a hose twice as big. Similarly, if you lower your <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> from 200 to 100, it takes twice as much light to expose the photo, so you need to double the duration of the shutter speed or double the size of the aperture.</p>

        <p>Of course, there are many different ways to fill a bucket: you can use a small hose for a long time, or a big hose for a short time, or a small hose for a small time if you’re filling a small bucket, etc. The same thing is true in photography. There are lots of different ways to correctly expose a photograph, and since each way will also affect how the photo looks, choosing one way over another is part of the creative process.</p>

        <h4>A Game of Trade-Offs</h4>

        <p>As you can now understand, photography is a game of trade-offs between these three factors. Suppose you take a photo at a medium aperture, medium shutter speed, and medium <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> and its exposure is correct (fills the bucket), but the motion is a little blurry. We know that to stop action, you need to use a faster shutter speed (don’t leave the water on for so long). But if you <span class="text-uppercase">only</span> change the shutter speed, then your “bucket” isn’t going to fill up.</p>

        <p>To make up for the change in shutter speed, you either need to let in more light with a larger aperture (bigger hose) or use a higher <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> (smaller bucket). But if you use a larger aperture, you get a shallower depth-of-field, and therefore, a more blurry background. If you use a higher <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> instead, you get more digital noise. In some cases a blurry background is desirable, so this may be an easy choice.</p>

        <p>This article is intended to give you a general understanding of the three most important concepts in photography and their relationship to each other. In the next article, I’ll explain the exact relationship between shutter speeds, apertures, and <span class="text-uppercase">Iso</span> so that when you change one of them in your camera, you can know instantly how to make up for it by changing another one.</p>

          <h3>Photo Composition: Balance</h3>

          <p>Balance is one of the most important elements of composition yet is also one of the hardest to describe, though we usually know it when we see it. The subject of compositional balance is not unique to photography; painters and other artists have been writing about the subject for centuries, yet there is still no standard way to codify it, though there are some good guidelines and strategies to help you achieve balance in your photos. Like anything else in the arts, many of the details will come down to personal preference.</p>

          <p>At the most general level, though, the concept of “balance” is that if you divide an image in half, the “visual weight” of the elements in one half should match the weight of the elements in the other half. This is true on the vertical and the horizontal axes of the image.</p>

          <p>The simplest example of this is symmetry, in which one half of the photo mirrors the other half exactly (or as close to exactly as possible). This type of balance is easy for the photographer to compose and for the viewer to understand, and it can be used to create a very powerful effect. However, there are two major problems with using symmetry as a compositional strategy: first, creating a strong composition with symmetry usually requires perfect symmetry, so relatively small differences in one half of the image can be very damaging to the composition. Second, and perhaps more importantly, is that symmetrical compositions are very simple and predictable, and therefore can get boring pretty quickly.</p>

          <p>In this image, there are two main elements: the large, black mountains in the upper left, and the white flower in the lower right. Within the limits of my crude artistry, this image is well balanced. Why? The mountain is much larger than the flower, they’re not similar shapes, there’s no symmetry.</p>

          <p>The answer is more dependent on the psychology of the observer than the specific shapes and forms. When an image is mostly dark, our eye is attracted to areas and objects that are bright. For that reason, the (relatively small) flowers in this image have much more “visual weight” than the larger, darker mountains. If we draw a vertical line down the center of the image, notice that each half of the shot is equally important to the overall image… and in fact, the same is true if we bisect the image with a horizontal line.</p>

          <p>For some people, the balance may be easier to see when the image is out of balance. Suppose that the “photographer” had taken a few steps to the right and shot the image with the flowers on the left. As you can see, the right side of the image seems empty and a bit superfluous. In fact, it almost seems that the left side of the image would work nicely as a square image, with the rest of the frame cut off.</p>

          <p>Bright areas are not the only elements that carry extra weight. In fact, there are too many specifics to list, and they can be dependent on an emotional response from the viewer just as easily as formal factors. A partial list might give you a good starting point, though:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Dark areas in an otherwise bright image</li>
            <li>Bright colors in an otherwise monochrome or drab image</li>
            <li>A contrasting color in an image containing mostly similar or complimentary colors</li>
            <li>Faces, especially eyes</li>
            <li>Human forms, especially naked ones</li>
            <li>Areas of sharp focus in images with significant areas that are blurry</li>
            <li>Objects that are closer to the camera carry a little more weight</li>
            <li>Objects that are physically heavier may also carry more visual weight (depending on the observer’s experience)</li>
            <li>Writing, symbols, and logos… particularly in unexpected places</li>
            <li>Small areas of fine detail in large areas of open space (negative space)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>It isn’t necessary to use balancing elements that carry extra weight; you can easily balance one large dark object with another large dark object, for example, but you run the risk of having multiple elements competing to be the subject of the image.</p>

          <p>I shot the image above at Cannon Beach on the Oregon Coast. The balance strategy is very similar to that in my diagrams above it; the large, dark rock and it’s reflection in the lower-left are balanced by the smaller sea-stacks in the upper right because they are set against a lighter area of the image backed by a contrasting color.</p>

          <p>While I was shooting in the Palouse of eastern Washington, there wasn’t a cloud in the sky. To help create an open, airy feeling in some of my photos, I included large swaths of empty sky. To balance it (without overpowering it), I included small areas of the ground with sharp, contrasty detail, like the trees and farmhouse above.</p>

          <h3>Basic Image Editing with Adobe Photoshop</h3>

          <p>Photoshop provides several ways to edit images without making changes to the underlying data of the original image, which is known as nondestructive editing. One such way is the Camera Raw environment. Many people are either completely unaware of the Camera Raw editing environment in Photoshop, or they wrongly assume that using Camera Raw requires images to be shot in the RAW format. But you can indeed edit the JPEG files from your camera in Camera Raw, and once you do, you will see how powerful and intuitive it is.</p>

          <p>All the edits you make in Camera Raw are stored back inside the original image metadata, so when you open the image again in Camera Raw in the future, all your edits can be adjusted or removed completely to return the image to its original state. Even image crops and touch-ups can be reversed.</p>

          <p>In the Photoshop environment, you can make nondestructive changes to your images using adjustment layers (as well as using Smart Objects). However, most of the other changes you make in Photoshop result in permanent changes to the image structure. That's not a bad thing. After all, Photoshop is the world-standard tool for altering pixels, and that's why we use it.</p>

          <h4>Developing a Workflow</h4>

          <p>We all have our own way of doing things, and I encourage you to develop your own photo-editing workflow. I make most of my basic image adjustments in Camera Raw. Then I move to Photoshop for touch-ups and more. Some people think this workflow is backwards, so feel free to reverse it if that's what you prefer. I start in Camera Raw because most of the time that is all I need.</p>

          <h4>Opening an Image in Camera Raw</h4>

          <p>To open an Image in Camera Raw:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Open Photoshop</li>
            <li>Choose File > Open from the main menu and browse to your <span class="text-uppercase">jpeg</span> file.</li>
            <li>Select the file, but be sure to change the file format to Camera Raw before opening the file.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The Histogram is signaling that shadows or highlights are being clipped. If you see clouds of dots like the red areas in Figure 2, your Histogram panel (the colorful panel on the top right of your screen) is telling you that shadows or highlights in the image are being clipped. As a general rule, you want the bell curve of the Histogram to fit nicely within the end points. To turn these visual indications off or on, click the triangles at the end of the Histogram. In this case, you see that the highlights, which are indicated on the right side, are clipped and the light blue triangle is highlighted.</p>

          <p>All of the sliders in this current view will affect the Histogram and the clipping of shadows and highlights. However, the Recovery slider is specifically intended to attempt to recover details from highlights, while the Fill Light slider attempts to recover details from image shadows without brightening the black in the image. You will see later that my highlights are no longer clipped after I make some initial image adjustments and decrease the Exposure setting.</p>

          <h4>Image Cropping in Camera Raw</h4>

          <p>The most obvious problem with this image is the orange fence. The sun was just coming up, so there's also a shadow that would have disappeared five minutes later. From the toolbar at the top of your screen, choose the Crop tool, and then select the area of the image you want to save. I have cropped just above the fence line and shadow. I have also cropped the top of the image to give it a widescreen look and to bring the focus back to the mountains (see Figure 3). Press Enter/Return for the crop to take effect. The cropped image removes the orange fence, the shadow, and some of the sky. If you select the Crop tool again, you will see that your entire image is still there (and will continue to remain there after you click Done). This confirms that the changes were not made to the original image.</p>

          <h4>The Basic Palette and Toolset</h4>

          <p>Camera Raw lays out the tool tabs in a left-to-right workflow that steps you through the image-editing process. But you can always go back and adjust previous changes, so feel free to run wild with your workflow. The first tab is called Basic. Here you can adjust the image balance to see how changes affect the image and the Histogram in real time. Figure 4 shows the quick adjustments I made to bring more balance, color, and vibrancy to the image. The Basic tab helps you adjust image balance, color, and vibrancy.</p>

          <h4>Tone Curve</h4>

          <p>Using a simple slider approach with understandable names, the interface in the Tone Curve tab lightens and darkens the shadows, highlights, and midtones in your images. You can also use a Curve adjustment layer to do the same thing in the Photoshop editing environment. There are two tabs in Camera Raw, Parametric and Point, which enable you to work with the tone curve in different ways. Figure 5 shows what my image looks like after adjusting the tone curve. The Tone Curve tab lightens and darkens the shadows, highlights, and midtones.</p>

          <h4>Image Noise Reduction</h4>

          <p>Image noise is a grainy color and brightness variation that shows up in many photos. In this photo, you can see image noise around the clouds. Noise reduction is a balancing act between smoothing those small variations while maintaining image detail. Too much reduction with not enough detail will result in a watercolor effect. Zoom in close enough to see the image noise, but not so close that you lose focus on important details. The rocks and trees of this image are good reference points to ensure you don't lose detail.</p>

          <p>Click the Detail button in the toolbar on the right side of your screen. The Noise Reduction options become available below. Start by sliding the Luminance Noise Reduction slider until the noise disappears, but some of the detail remains. Then increase the Luminance Detail as necessary until more of the detail returns, but the noise doesn't. Experiment with these sliders as well as the Color and Color Detail sliders as necessary. You might also want to experiment with the Sharpening palette after performing noise reduction. Once you play around with them, you'll see why all of these controls are grouped together.</p>

          <p>Note: Image noise can also be reduced using the Noise Filter in Photoshop or through some tricky surface blurs and masking. I usually prefer to use Camera Raw because it offers an easier workflow with superior nondestructive results. However, you may prefer to target your noise reduction to a certain area of the image in Photoshop. These three tool palettes cover the majority of the basic editing adjustments I make to most images, but take some time to get familiar with all of them.</p>

          <h4>Basic Image Touch-Up in Photoshop</h4>

          <p>With these basic fixes, my image looks pretty good. But if I remove those bushes in the foreground, it will look even better. So let's move out of Camera Raw and use some of the Photoshop touch-up tools. To edit the image in Photoshop in its current state as a flattened rasterized layer, click Open Image. To edit the image as a Smart Object, hold down the Shift key and click Open Image. Many Photoshop tools work on Smart Objects, but the Healing and Clone tools require a rasterized image. To rasterize a Smart Object, right click or Control-click on the Smart Object Layer and choose Rasterize Layer.</p>

          <h4>Small Touch-Ups with the Spot Healing Brush</h4>

          <p>Photoshop provides so many great options for touching up images. Personal preference, along with trial and error, will dictate which tools you use on a given image. The size of the area to be touched up and the objects surrounding the touch-up area will also factor into your success with any given tool.</p>

          <p>The Spot Healing brush with Content Aware Fill does an amazing job for most small touch-ups, such as the branch in the lower left corner. (Tip: The Spot Healing brush works best on straight lines. If you have an area to remove that is not comprised of straight line, try using Selection with Edit > Fill: Content-Aware. To get the best result, select as small a selection as possible). I'm going to remove the little one on the left side first, as part of my overall strategy to get rid of the big bush in the middle.</p>

          <p>Select the Spot Healing brush and make sure that Content-Aware is selected in the settings at the top of your screen. Adjust the brush size to be slightly wider than what is required to paint over any spots that need to be removed. To resize brushes quickly, use the ] key to increase brush size, and the [ key to decrease brush size. In this case, I have used a small brush that's slightly wider than the individual branches. With a single stroke over each branch, they disappear, and Photoshop does a great job of automatically filling the area left behind The Spot Healing brush removes the portions of the image you select. The original image now has the small branch on the left and a few other small artifacts at the bottom removed.</p>

          <h4>Larger Touch-Ups with the Healing Brush and Clone Tool</h4>

          <p>For that big bush in the middle, I found through trial and error that I get my best results using a large Healing brush to wipe the bottom of it out all at one time. The Healing brush requires you to select a source point (a background or texture you'd like to paint over the offending pixels), and then paint over the area you want to remove, but it also attempts to blend and match color. Photoshop has so many methods for doing touch-ups, but they don't all work for a given situation. So you sometimes have to use trial and error to find the best tool for the job. The Healing brush replaces whatever you paint with the source you select. Removing the small branch gave me a nice clean area to use as my source, so I Alt-clicked that area with a brush and painted over the bottom part of the larger bush.</p>

          <p>I then used the Clone tool to finish removing the smaller parts of this bush. Keep an eye out for redundant patches in your image created by the Healing brush or Clone tool. Because these tools grab content from other parts of the image, you can end up with patterns that make it obvious your image was altered in Photoshop. When you're finished with these touch-ups, select the Sharpen tool and pass over some of the areas to get rid of that smudged look that can be left behind by these types of fixes. Figure 8 shows my image after it has been edited. The Healing and Clone tools help you remove unwanted parts of your photo.</p>

          <h4>Adjustment Layers and Masks</h4>

          <p>As I mentioned previously, adjustment layers are how Photoshop handles nondestructive editing. To create an adjustment layer, click the Adjustment Layers button at the bottom of the Layers palette, or select the Adjustments palette. The mountains and foreground of my image are still just a bit too dark, but I like the sky as it is. Click the Brightness/Contrast Adjustment button, and it will create a new layer--as well as a layer mask. If you make changes to the brightness at this point, those changes will affect the whole image. To make brightness changes to only certain parts of the image, choose Window > Masks to open the Masks palette (if it is not already open). You have the option of creating vector masks and pixel masks with the two buttons in the upper right corner. Select Add A Pixel Mask and then click the Color Range button.</p>

          <p>Using the Eyedropper tools on the right side, experiment by selecting portions of the image to see what happens. If you select the blue of the sky, the Brightness adjustment will affect the sky. I used the Eyedropper with the plus sign to select the foreground and then added the mountains and other small color selections with additional clicks. If you select something you didn't mean to select, you can remove it from the selection by clicking it again using the Eyedropper with the minus sign. When you have selected everything you want to change, go back to the Adjustments palette with the Brightness adjustment layer selected and tweak the brightness.</p>

          <p>To get back to the main screen of the Adjustments menu, click the arrow in the lower left corner of the palette. You can experiment with all the other adjustment layers to see how they affect your image. Keep in mind that they are layers, so you can also change their opacity and blend types, which creates an unbelievable range of looks.The final image after adjustments in Camera Raw and Photoshop.</p>
